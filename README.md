Description of custom sorting algorithm
---------------------------------------
It's a Dual Pivot Quick Sort.

Notes on using Copilot (or other AI)
------------------------------------
I asked Chatgpt for the most efficient sorting algorithm, and I chose Dual Pivot Quick Sort because Chatgpt says it's quick for sorting integer array. And I used the code generated by Chatgpt and changed it to the format I want. In the testing, I found it's extremely inefficient for Reversed array condition, so I asked Chatgpt to choose the middle element as pivot.
